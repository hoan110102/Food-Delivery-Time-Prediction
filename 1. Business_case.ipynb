    "# Food Delivery Time Analysis and Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to leverage the skills of a Data Analyst to solve a real-world problem. Using a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques, I will analyze a dataset to uncover hidden patterns and relationships between variables. Through this analysis, I hope to gain new insights that can inform decision making and lead to actionable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will consist of several stages, including data collection, cleaning and pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation. I will use a variety of tools and technologies, such as Python and visualization libraries to facilitate this process, and the stages will be separated into different notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the purpose of this project is to go through the usual steps for a data analysis workflow and demonstrate my thought process while solving a problem, in this case, I will be working on a real-world problem of solving the food delivery time problem of delivery companies in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal with this project is to use statistical methods and build a predictive model to solve the problem in the most efficient way possible, with an evaluation of the trained model and taking into account the practical implementation of the model.\n",

    "## Project Introduction\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last few years, food delivery has experienced major expansion with the inception of the online platforms that connect customers, delivery drivers and restaurants. One of the difficulties that customers face is the uncertainty surrounding delivery times that prompts researchers to come up with predictive models that will allow estimations of delivery duration, so that the food delivery time prediction model will play a vital role in this industry. Delivery time directly affects customer satisfaction and their overall experience. The model helps optimise operations, streamline logistics, and meet customer expectations by providing reliable estimates of when the food will be delivered\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problems description\n",
    "Food Delivery services need to vices likeshow the time it will take to deliver the order to keep transparency with their customers. Showing accurate delivery times is crucial for Delivery company because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Expectations:** In today's fast-paced world, customers have come to expect convenience and efficiency when it comes to food delivery. Providing accurate delivery time estimates helps manage customer expectations and ensures they are aware of when their order will arrive. It enhances transparency and helps build trust between the platform and the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Satisfaction:** Delivery time accuracy directly impacts customer satisfaction. If a delivery is consistently delayed or arrives much later than anticipated, it can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction. On the other hand, if the estimated delivery time is reliable and the order arrives promptly, it enhances the overall customer experience and increases the likelihood of repeat business.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Management:** Accurate delivery time predictions enable customers to plan their day effectively. By knowing when their order will arrive, they can schedule their activities accordingly, whether it's waiting at home or stepping out briefly. This feature is particularly important for busy individuals who have limited time and need to manage their daily routines efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operational Efficiency:** Reliable delivery time predictions allow delivery platforms to optimize their operations. By accurately estimating delivery times, they can manage their fleet of delivery partners more effectively, assign orders based on distance and estimated delivery time, and streamline the entire delivery process. This can lead to improved efficiency, reduced idle time, and better resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Retention:** Timely delivery is crucial for customer retention. When customers have a positive experience with on-time deliveries, they are more likely to continue using the service and recommend it to others. On the other hand, frequent delays or unreliable delivery times can drive customers away, leading to a loss of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, accurate delivery time predictions are vital to manage customer expectations, enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, build a positive reputation, and ultimately retain and attract customers. By applying analysis and analytics, these platforms can improve their prediction capabilities, leading to a more reliable and enjoyable food delivery experience for customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project objective\n",
    "\n",
    "By using data analysis and statistical techniques, we can build a simple model to identify the factors that affect delivery time, and then propose some solutions based on each factor to improve the time. In addition, we will also build a powerful predictive model to be able to estimate the required delivery time based on the actual factors at that time. These factors can include traffic conditions, time of day, day of week, weather conditions, and even the current workload of delivery partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the model can be continuously improved and updated as new data becomes available. By regularly updating the model with the latest delivery data, we can perform some techniques such as Retrain model to ensure that the model remains relevant and reflects the changing conditions and trends in the delivery process.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that real-time delivery time prediction requires a dynamic and responsive system. As new orders come in and delivery partners are assigned, the model needs to recalculate and adjust the estimated delivery time based on current circumstances. This ensures that customers receive up-to-date and reliable information about when they can expect their food to arrive."
