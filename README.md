# Introduction
In the last few years, food delivery has experienced major expansion with the inception of the online platforms that connect customers, delivery drivers and restaurants. One of the difficulties that customers face is the uncertainty surrounding delivery times that prompts researchers to come up with predictive models that will allow estimations of delivery duration, so that the food delivery time prediction model will play a vital role in this industry. Delivery time directly affects customer satisfaction and their overall experience. The model helps optimise operations, streamline logistics, and meet customer expectations by providing reliable estimates of when the food will be delivered.

In this project, I will be performing an supervised machine learning - Regression on a dataset contains the factors that can be affect to food delivery time. I will build a regression model to estimate the time it will take a driver to deliver to the destination.

# Datasets
