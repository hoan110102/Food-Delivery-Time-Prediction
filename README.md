# Summary
Accurate time estimation is crucial to ensure customer satisfaction and operational efficiency in the growing food delivery industry. This project focuses on analyzing the factors affecting food delivery time and evaluating the performance of machine learning models in estimating delivery time. For this purpose, this project has compiled a detailed dataset from a food delivery company on the Kaggle, including delivery addresses, order times, delivery times, weather conditions, traffic intensity, and delivery person profile information. The project has evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of various machine learning models such as LightGBM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and k-nearest nearest neighbor (KNN) using metrics such as MAE and RMSE. The results demonstrate that the LGBMRegressor model outperforms other models in accurately predicting delivery times with RMSE and MAE values after optimization of 3.86 and 3.08, respectively. In addition, a thorough analysis of the impact of each feature through a linear regression model has revealed that most of the factors have an impact on delivery times. This project provides insights into leveraging machine learning techniques to optimize food delivery operations and improve customer satisfaction. These findings can assist food delivery platforms in implementing effective time estimation models and highlighting factors for prediction.
